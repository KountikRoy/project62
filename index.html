            <p>Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if youâ€™re going through an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment and potentially hasten healing. 
                A yoga therapist can work with patients and put together individualized plans that work together with their medical and surgical therapies. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress.</p>

By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.</p>
